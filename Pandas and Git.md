## Pandas üêº

### 1. What is Pandas?

Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets, you should know this by now. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.

Speaking of *analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating* data, what functions can you use for each of these tasks? ü§î:
- **A**nalyze data?
- **C**lean data?
- **E**xplore data?
- **M**anipulate data?

**Fill the table below:**
  

function | what it does | category
------------ | ----------- | ---------
astype()	|Casts a pandas object to a specified datatype.|	Data Manipulation
groupby()	| Groups data based on one or more columns and applies a function to each group|Data Manipulation
sort_values()	|Sorts a DataFrame by one or more columns |	Data Manipulation
 pivot_table()	|Creates a spreadsheet-style pivot table as a DataFrame|	Data Manipulation
merge()|	Merges two or more DataFrames into a single DataFrame|	Data Manipulation
plot()	|Creates a variety of plots, including line, bar, and scatter plots|	Data Visualization
corr()|	Computes pairwise correlation of columns, excluding NA/null values.	|Data Analysis
cov()	|Computes pairwise covariance of columns, excluding NA/null values.	|Data Analysis
apply()	|Applies a function along an axis of the DataFrame|	Data Manipulation
loc()	|Accesses a group of rows and columns by label(s) or a boolean array.	|Indexing and Selecting Data
iloc()|	Accesses a group of rows and columns by integer position(s).	|Indexing and Selecting Data
iterrows()	|Iterates over the rows of a DataFrame as (index, Series) pairs.	|Iteration
aggregate()|	Applies one or more operations to groups of data.| Similar to groupby().

### 2. Pandas and NumPy üî¢ [BONUS üéÅ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068680/)

Pandas is built on top of the NumPy package, which means that many of the methods in NumPy are also available in Pandas. Data in pandas is often used to feed statistical analysis in SciPy, plotting functions from Matplotlib, and machine learning algorithms in Scikit-learn.

Speaking of NumPy, here are questions about it:

- What is the output of the following code? And why is it so?

``` python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
c = np.vstack((a, b))

print(c[1][2])
```
# Output = 6 because it will become as 2D Array so c[1][2] is the element int the second row and the third column 



- What is the output of the following code? And why is it so?

``` python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
c = np.intersect1d(a, b)

print(c)
```
# Output = [] because there is no common elements between two arrays

  
- What is the output of the following code? And why is it so?

``` python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
c = np.setdiff1d(a, b)

print(c)
```
# output =[1,2,3] it gives the the elements that exist in a and not in b

- Which of the following is a function in NumPy used for carrying out Einstein summations?

    - [ ]  `np.tensordot()`
    - [ ] ¬†`np.dot()`
    - [x] ¬†`np.einsum()`
    - [ ] ¬†`np.outer()`

- The `np.outer` function is primarily intended for:

    - [ ] ¬†Computing the tensor dot product of two arrays.
    - [x] ¬†Computing the outer product of two arrays.
    - [ ] ¬†Computing the inner product of two arrays.
    - [ ] ¬†Computing the cross product of two arrays.


### 3. Pandas and Matplotlib üìà
Pandas can be used to visualize data using a wrapper for `matplotlib.pyplot.plot()`. You can plot data directly from your DataFrame using certain functions.

- What functions can you use to plot data directly from your DataFrame? ü§î

- What is the output of the following code? And why is it so?

``` python
df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(10, 4), columns=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])
df.plot.scatter(x='a', y='b')
```
- What do you know about `np.random.randn()`? And how does it depend on `np.random.seed()`?
